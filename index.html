                <p>My dear Prernaaaaaaaaa, I have been incredibly blessed to have you in my life for the past years. As we have grown closer, I really wanna say it clear that I have realized that my feelings for you have gone beyond just friendship. And you know somewhere we were really attached to each other and maybe we still are, but that was not the right timeeee to take things forward ðŸ¥º, I still remember when we used to talk alot day and night like we have something between us, for days we literally forgot that we are just friends, we were literally like an couple, i remember talking to you in night sitting on my terrace, Voh Chand ke photo bhejke tere sath flirt karnaðŸ‘‰ðŸ‘ˆ, Voh maccharo ka mujhee kaatnaðŸ¤£, voh macchar bhi mujhe worth it lagte the uss time because I used to talk to you aur mujhe accha lagta tha, you make me happy alwaysðŸ’œ, I was in a dark space because of someone and you pulled me out of that, that was the time i started falling for you more and more, Falling for you was never my plan but it happened because you have such a beautiful mind also we connect so good, we are just good together, whenever we talk, flirt, or fight, everything is so pretty with you, and I promise to love, respect, and support you in every way possible and to give you unconditionally, uncomplicated, sure, consistent love, and I look forward to building a great future togetherðŸ¤ž.
                  I know I said before ki we can't date because of my friendship with your ex, but fuck that shit, i will take care of that, I've realized my feelings for you have grown stronger and i can't stop it as we have discussed many times that we really are the perfect match for each other, we were just mismatched ðŸ˜‚, bhagwan ne tujhe mujhse milane ke liyee hi uske life me dala tha for sure, meri upar wale se baat ho chuki hai, don't worry ðŸ˜ŽðŸ˜Ž . Also I totally understand if you don't feel the same way, but I have always been taught to be honest every fucking time. Atleast I will not regret in future for not confessing my feelings for you. You deserve the world and all the good things it has to offer. And i promise to give you that, and If I fail to give that world to you, I promise to give you mineðŸ’œ.
                  I must be a snowflake because I've fallen for you, you was in my dream for 5 continuous days, idk why and how but yeah, we know each other on a really good level, haan there might be some things we don't know about eachother, so let's find out those together ðŸ‘€and have each other in life officially as couples ðŸ˜©ðŸ’œ.
                  I remember that day you said ki "Meko bata me support kregi teko exam ke time thike" that was the day i felt that yes you are the one and i started planning this proposalðŸ™ˆ.
                  there are choices given, you can accept me or can reject me, but there's one thing clear that I can keep you happy like the way no one else ever can. Good luck for your decision (fingers crossed)</p>
